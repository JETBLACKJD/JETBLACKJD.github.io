A few things that I've learned so far is that maintaining any sort of blog or website is hard. 
It's tough work trying to figure out what to type especially if I feel like I haven't made any sort of progress.
That being said I do have a few goals I want to complete in March.

  1. I want to secure a job for after I graduate.
  2. Get better at JavaScript and get some more hands on experience with React.
  3. Learn about data visualization. It seems really cool and stokes my creative fire within.
  
I want to do all that while I also prepare for the interviews that I (hopefully) get.
